Hey there, you're probably here because your migrations aren't running correctly. Before you puch this computer try this command if you've already created changes in your models

alembic revision --autogenerate -m ""

THEN...
DON'T FORGET the command...

alembic upgrade head

# If you fuck up and you're getting pissed, delete the alemshit.ini file and initialize your db again
in the alemshit.ini file add
sqlalchemy.url = db_url_here

# env.py file below
from	sql_app.models	import	Base
target_metadata	=	Base.metadata

url	=	config.get_main_option("sqlalchemy.url")
context.configure(
	url=url,
	target_metadata=target_metadata,
	literal_binds=True,
	dialect_opts={"paramstyle":	"named"},
	render_as_batch=True
)

with	connectable.connect()	as	connection:
		context.configure(
			connection=connection,
			target_metadata=target_metadata,
			render_as_batch=True,
		)

# create a new postgres database below
